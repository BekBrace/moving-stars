      <h1>What is a star?</h1>
      <p>
        A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of
        plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is
        the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during
        the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky
        due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most
        prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the
        brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star
        catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized
        stellar designations. The observable Universe contains an estimated
        1×1024 stars,[1][2] but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth,
        including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way. For most of its
        active life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into
        helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior
        and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring
        elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis
        during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova
        nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can
        also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age,
        metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star
        by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum
        respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that
        determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a
        star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while
        the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the
        temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot
        known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a
        particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of
        that star to be determined. A star's life begins with the gravitational
        collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen,
        along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the
        stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted
        into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.[3]
        The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core
        through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer
        processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing
        further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times
        the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in
        its core is exhausted.[4] In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements
        at the core or in shells around the core. As the star expands it throws
        a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the
        interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.[5]
        Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron
        star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole.
